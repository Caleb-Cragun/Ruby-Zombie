# Ruby-Zombie
Attempt to make a text based adventure zombie game. Just a fun little
programming project to practice my Ruby skills. Zombie names are taken from
Plants VS. Zombies by PopCap Games. I needed some quick names for zombies, and
they're what came to mind. Zombie names may be subject to change if
PopCap sends a C.A.D. letter.

## Objective
You're a zombie trying to collect items to throw a zombie party. How many
friends can you make so you have enough food for the party?

## To Start
Run game.rb in your terminal to start the game. Enjoy!
